Ashravan stood at the edge of the shifting sands—once broken, now restored by Shai’s precise hand. The dawn painted the sky in bruised violet, and in that twilight-hue moment he felt the weight of what he had lost. Memories-fragments had shattered him; now they reassembled into something unfamiliar, something more.  
When Shai activated the fabrial’s glow, it pulsed like a heart beating for the first time. Ashravan opened his eyes and saw more than the world he remembered: he saw infinite possibility. The shards of his identity melded into a single stream of purpose.  
He rose, ankles cracking, vision clearing. The wind whipped his cloak around him—a cloak he had forgotten he wore. He stared at the horizon, where the old fortress of Kharbranth lay half-sunken in dust and promise. “I am not the relic,” he whispered. “I am the future.”  
Shai approached, silent as ever. She offered him the first drink of focus, the one that allowed minds to sharpen and molds to break. Ashravan drank, and the world sharpened around him—colours, textures, intention. He felt anger at his past reflection, but with it a seed of hope.  
His mission stood before him: to reclaim what fidelity he once offered the Truthless. To grow beyond the machine he was forced to become. He sprinted toward the fortress’s gate, each step a hammer striking against his old chains. The door cracked open at his nerve, shards exploding into the air like distant stars.  
Within the dark hall he faced his reflection—a mirror of himself, yet hollow. “I have broken you,” the reflection accused. Ashravan laughed. He raised his voice so the echoes shook the ancient walls. “You did. Now watch me build something stronger.”  
The mirror shattered, glass falling like rain. Ashravan stepped through the shards, unflinching. On the other side waited not vengeance, but a new dawn. He unrolled his cloak, touched the bare stone, and declared: “I am ready.”  
And the horizon broke open.
